# Hyper Parameters
----

There are 3 primary hyper parameters :

- DiscreteHyperParameter (DiscreteHP)
- UniformContinuousHyperParameter (UniformHP)
- NormalContinuousHyperParameter (NormalHP)

As their names suggest, each hyper paramter takes specific parameters or value ranges.

- Discrete Hyper Parmeters takes lists of any python data type that can be serialized.
    -   This includes numpy values, and even numpy arrays

- Continuous Hyper Parameters take ranges of values
    -   Uniform Continuous Hyper Parameters will sample uniformly between the min and max values
    -   Normal Continuous Hyper Parameters will sample from the normal distribution with the provided mean and standard deviation

A special composite hyper parameter, called `HyperParameterList` is used to provide a convenient interface to several
hyper parameters at once, and is used internally by the training algorithm.
