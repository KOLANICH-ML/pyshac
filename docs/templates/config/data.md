# Datasets
----

The `Dataset` class is used to provide utilities for data management, such as adding training samples,
encoding and decoding data points for the training, serialization and restoration to continue training and so on.

A `Dataset` is an internal component of the algorithm being used, and will often not be interacted with directly.
It provides a convenient interface to the `HyperParameterList` that is used to wrap the hyper parameters, and its
serialization / recovery for multiple training runs.
