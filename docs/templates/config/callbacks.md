# Callbacks
------

Callbacks can be used with PySHAC for custom code execution, such as monitoring the improvement of the engine,
maintaining a history of the training session or simply writing the logs to files.

Callbacks allow you the flexibility to prepare your state prior to training or evaluation, and in doing so can
allow one to perform stateful evaluation if necessary using concurrent evaluators.
