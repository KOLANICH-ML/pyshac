# SHAC Managed Engine for PyTorch

Provides a managed engine for PyTorch workflows when using SHAC.

SHAC Engine specifically built for PyTorch when using CPUs/GPUs.

This engine is used primarily for its management of how many evaluation processes
are used, and to provide a unified interface similar to TensorflowSHAC in determining
the number of GPUs and CPU cores used.

Since PyTorch allocates memory to the graph dynamically, graph maintanence is
unnecessary. As long as the system has enough memory to run multiple copies of
the evaluation model, there is no additional work required by the user inside the
evaluation function.

If parallel evaluation is not preferred, please refer the [Serial Evaluation](../serial-execution.md) page.
