# SHAC Managed Engine for Tensorflow
----

Provides a managed engine for Tensorflow workflows when using SHAC.

Performs a few useful tasks such as :

- Provide a tf.Session object: In addition to the worker id and the parameter dictionary, a tf.Session is provided as the first
parameter to the evaluation function. This session wraps the underlying graph, and can be used to freely evaluate all operations
inside the evaluation function.

- Graph scope management: All Tensorflow operations inside the evalution function will be under the scope of a managed tf.Graph,
such that the provided session can be used to evaluate all ops inside the evaluation function.

- Memory Management: One the evaluation is done, the graph destruction and session closing are managed automatically.

If parallel evaluation is not preferred, please refer the [Serial Evaluation](../serial-execution.md) page.
